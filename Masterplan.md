## Project Overview
This document outlines the masterplan for creating a secure, client-side Random Password Generator. The application will be a web-based tool built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, focused on providing a clean, modern, and intuitive user experience. Users will be able to generate strong, customizable passwords, check their strength, copy them to the clipboard, and optionally save a list of generated passwords to their browser's local storage. The entire application will run in the user's browser, ensuring that no sensitive data is ever transmitted to a server, providing maximum privacy and security.

## Project Goals
- To develop a highly secure password generation tool where all operations are performed client-side.
- To provide users with comprehensive customization options for password generation, including length, character types, and the exclusion of ambiguous characters.
- To offer an intuitive user experience with a clean, minimalist interface and instant feedback, including a robust password strength indicator.
- To enable users to easily copy passwords and persist a list of favorites locally for convenience.
- To build a performant, reliable, and easily maintainable application using a modern tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS).

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Icons**: `lucide-react`
- **Password Strength Analysis**: `zxcvbn-ts`
- **Backend**: None (The application is fully client-side. Node.js is used as the runtime environment for Next.js development and server-side rendering of the static shell).
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- **Password Generation:** Generate passwords based on user-defined criteria.
- **Customization Options:**
    - Slider for password length (e.g., 8-128 characters).
    - Checkboxes for including: Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, Numbers, and Symbols.
    - A toggle to exclude ambiguous characters (e.g., `I, l, 1, O, 0`).
- **Strength Indicator:** A visual bar and text label (e.g., "Weak", "Strong") to show the strength of the generated password, powered by `zxcvbn-ts`.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** A one-click button to copy the generated password.
- **Local Saved List:** A feature allowing users to "save" a generated password to a list that is persisted in the browser's Local Storage. This list can also be cleared.
- **Responsive Design:** The application will be fully responsive and usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Out of Scope
- User accounts and authentication.
- Cloud-based storage or synchronization of passwords.
- A browser extension version.
- Generation of pronounceable passphrases (diceware).
- Team or enterprise features.
- Storing a history of all generated passwords (only user-saved ones are kept).

## Functional Requirements

### Feature Area 1: Password Generation & Customization
- **FR1.1:** The user MUST be able to specify the password length using a slider component.
- **FR1.2:** The user MUST be able to select which character sets to include in the password from the following options: Uppercase (A-Z), Lowercase (a-z), Numbers (0-9), and Symbols (`!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}`|;:',./<>?`).
- **FR1.3:** The user MUST be able to toggle a setting to exclude ambiguous characters (`I, l, 1, O, 0`).
- **FR1.4:** The application MUST generate a new password instantly whenever a generation parameter is changed.
- **FR1.5:** The password generation logic MUST use the browser's `window.crypto` API for cryptographically secure random numbers.

### Feature Area 2: User Interaction & Feedback
- **FR2.1:** The generated password MUST be clearly displayed in a prominent input field.
- **FR2.2:** The user MUST be able to copy the current password to the clipboard by clicking a "Copy" button.
- **FR2.3:** The application MUST display a visual confirmation (e.g., "Copied!") when the password has been copied.
- **FR2.4:** The application MUST display a password strength score and a descriptive label based on `zxcvbn-ts` analysis. The strength meter should update in real-time with the generated password.

### Feature Area 3: Local Storage
- **FR3.1:** The user MUST be able to click a "Save" button to add the currently generated password to a "Saved Passwords" list.
- **FR3.2:** The "Saved Passwords" list MUST be persisted in the browser's Local Storage.
- **FR3.3:** The user MUST be able to view the list of saved passwords on the page.
- **FR3.4:** The user MUST be able to copy any password from the saved list.
- **FR3.5:** The user MUST be able to remove individual passwords from the saved list.
- **FR3.6:** The user MUST be able to clear the entire list of saved passwords.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The UI must be highly responsive. Password generation and strength calculation must be instantaneous (<100ms).
- **Security:** All password generation and storage is strictly client-side. The application will not transmit generated passwords or user settings over the network.
- **Usability:** The interface must be simple, intuitive, and self-explanatory for users of all technical abilities.
- **Maintainability:** Code will be well-structured, commented, and follow the principles outlined in the Development Guidelines.
- **Accessibility:** The application should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, including keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and proper ARIA attributes.

## Implementation Plan
This section outlines the implementation plan. It is detailed enough for an AI code assistant to implement the final product without additional input.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
- **Task 1:** Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS using `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --tailwind`.
- **Task 2:** Install necessary dependencies: `zxcvbn-ts` for password strength, `lucide-react` for icons, and `sonner` for toast notifications (e.g., "Copied!").
- **Task 3:** Set up the basic project structure (directories for `components`, `lib`, `hooks`).
- **Task 4:** Create the main page layout in `app/page.tsx` with a placeholder title and structure.
- **Task 5:** Configure Tailwind CSS theme settings (colors, fonts) in `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Phase 2: Core UI Components
- **Task 1:** Create a `PasswordDisplay.tsx` component that shows the generated password and includes the "Copy" button.
- **Task 2:** Create a `SettingsPanel.tsx` component to house all customization options.
- **Task 3:** Inside `SettingsPanel.tsx`, implement a `Slider` component for length selection.
- **Task 4:** Inside `SettingsPanel.tsx`, implement `Checkbox` components for character type selection (Uppercase, Lowercase, etc.).
- **Task 5:** Inside `SettingsPanel.tsx`, implement a `Switch` component for the "Exclude Ambiguous Characters" option.
- **Task 6:** Create a `StrengthIndicator.tsx` component that displays a colored bar and text label.
- **Task 7:** Assemble all components on the main page, creating a cohesive and responsive layout.

### Phase 3: Core Logic & State Management
- **Task 1:** Implement the main state management using `useState` in the root page component (`app/page.tsx`) to hold settings (length, char types) and the generated password.
- **Task 2:** Create the password generation logic in `lib/password.ts`.
    - The function will accept the settings object as an argument.
    - It will construct a character set based on the settings.
    - It will use `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` to securely pick random characters from the set.
    - It will return the final password string.
- **Task 3:** Wire the UI components to the state. Use a `useEffect` hook to call the generation function whenever any setting changes.
- **Task 4:** Implement the "Copy to Clipboard" functionality using the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` API and trigger a toast notification on success.
- **Task 5:** Integrate the `zxcvbn-ts` library. Pass the generated password to `zxcvbn` and use the result to update the `StrengthIndicator` component's state.

### Phase 4: Local Storage Feature
- **Task 1:** Create a custom hook `useLocalStorage.ts`. This hook will abstract the logic for reading from and writing to Local Storage, keeping the state synchronized with the component.
- **Task 2:** Create a `SavedPasswordsList.tsx` component.
- **Task 3:** In the main page component, use the `useLocalStorage` hook to manage an array of saved passwords (`const [saved, setSaved] = useLocalStorage('savedPasswords', [])`).
- **Task 4:** Implement the "Save" button logic to add the current password to the `saved` array.
- **Task 5:** The `SavedPasswordsList` component will render the `saved` array, providing "Copy" and "Delete" buttons for each entry.
- **Task 6:** Implement the "Clear All" functionality, which resets the `saved` state to an empty array.

### Phase 5: Testing, Refinement & Deployment
- **Task 1:** Perform manual testing across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and screen sizes.
- **Task 2:** Add unit tests for the password generation logic in `lib/password.ts` using Jest.
- **Task 3:** Refine the UI/UX, ensuring smooth animations, clear feedback, and full accessibility compliance.
- **Task 4:** Create the final `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files.
- **Task 5:** Deploy the application to Vercel via a Git repository integration.

## API Endpoints
- Not applicable. This application is 100% client-side.

## Data Models
### SavedPassword (in Local Storage)
The `savedPasswords` key in Local Storage will hold a JSON stringified array of objects with the following structure:
```typescript
[
  {
    "id": "string", // A unique identifier, e.g., timestamp or UUID
    "value": "string" // The saved password string
  }
]
```

## Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for this project as there are no API keys or external services that require configuration. An empty `.env.example` file can be included for convention.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Jest will be used to test the core password generation function (`lib/password.ts`) to ensure it correctly handles different settings and character sets.
- **Manual Testing:** The application will be manually tested on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and various device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to check for functionality, responsiveness, and usability bugs.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Tools like Lighthouse and WAVE will be used to audit the application for accessibility issues.

## Deployment Strategy
The application will be deployed on Vercel. The deployment process will be automated by connecting a GitHub repository to a Vercel project. Pushing to the `main` branch will trigger a production deployment.

## Maintenance Plan
- **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update dependencies (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.) to their latest stable versions to incorporate security patches and new features.
- **Bug Fixes:** Monitor user feedback (if any channels are established) and address any reported bugs promptly.
- **Feature Enhancements:** Consider adding features from the "Future Enhancements" list based on user demand.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Weak Randomness Source | High | Low | Strictly use the browser's `window.crypto` API, which is designed for cryptographic operations, instead of `Math.random()`. |
| Insecure Local Storage | Medium | Low | Acknowledge that while local storage is sandboxed, a compromised browser (e.g., via malicious extensions) could access it. Since this is a generator, not a manager, the risk is lower. Advise users to clear the list regularly. |
| UI/UX Flaws | Low | Medium | Conduct thorough manual testing on multiple devices. Follow accessibility best practices from the start to ensure the tool is usable by everyone. |

## Future Enhancements
- **Passphrase Generation:** Add a feature to generate "diceware" style passphrases (e.g., "correct-horse-battery-staple").
- **Export to File:** Allow users to download their saved password list as a `.txt` or `.csv` file.
- **Advanced Theming:** Allow users to toggle between a light and dark theme.
- **Password History:** Keep a temporary history of the last 5-10 generated passwords within the current session.

## Development Guidelines
- **Code Quality:** Follow SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles. Code should be clean, modular, and well-commented.
- **Frontend:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling. UI should be modern, clean, and intuitive, adhering to WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.
- **Data Handling:** No placeholder data. Logic must be self-contained. Centralize constants (like symbol sets) in one place.
- **Documentation:** Maintain a comprehensive `README.md` and a `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Tool Usage Instructions
- **Context:** Use `context7` MCP server for contextual information.
- **Problem-Solving:** Use the `clear_thought` servers for structured thinking.
- **Date/Time:** Use `getCurrentDateTime_node` for timestamps in documentation.
- **Web Search:** Use the `websearch` tool for research.
- **System:** Adhere to Windows 11/PowerShell command conventions (`New-Item -ItemType Directory`, `;` separator). Use language-native path libraries.
- **Error Handling:** Attempt to resolve errors autonomously before reporting blockers.

## Conclusion
This masterplan provides a complete blueprint for developing a high-quality, secure, and user-friendly Random Password Generator. By following this plan, an AI code assistant will have all the necessary information to build the final product efficiently and effectively, meeting all specified requirements.
